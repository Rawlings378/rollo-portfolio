# TODO: Make Bottom Navigation Bar Clickable for Navigation

- [x] Edit `lib/pages/home_page.dart` to modify the `onTap` callback in `BottomNavigationBar` to navigate to appropriate routes using `Navigator.pushNamed` for indices 1 and 2, while keeping index 0 as is since it's the homepage.
- [x] Add comments on each changed line explaining the modification.
- [x] Test the navigation functionality by running the app.
